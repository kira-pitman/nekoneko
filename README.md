## WHAT

Full stack application to showcase my friends cats! Includes information about cats such as owner, location, image(s), and key facts! 

## WHY

It's been a hot second since my last effort at buliding a website from scratch! Given how far my plant project has progressed I figured the best way to brush up on my skills would be to just make another one - particularly to refresh buliding something from the backend! It is very similar to the plant project in terms of functionality, but will hopefully allow for a bit of playing around with UX as well as the structural coding!
